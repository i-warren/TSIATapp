# This Ship is a Tomb Companion App
This app is designed to help the gamemaster (GM) run This Ship is a Tomb, a procedurally generated adventure written for the Mothership tabletop roleplaying game (RPG). 
During the adventure itself, the party will be exploring a starship. As the group progresses, new locations, details and events are randomly determined based upon how far into the ship the group has explored. 
The app will keep track of how ‘deep’ the group is into the ship by a section integer, and when they travel to a new location it will provide the user with the generated string details derived from that integer. 
As the group moves each Location and Detail will be stored in an ArrayList.
